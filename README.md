# Transportation-Performance-Dashboard

# Project summary  
The Transportation Performance Dashboard analyzes 3,558 logistics bookings from 2019-2020, revealing a 61.5% delay rate, average delivery time of 7.94 days, and key inefficiencies in routes, materials, vehicles, suppliers, and customers to enhance supply chain reliability and reduce operational delays in a predominantly regular shipment environment.

# Objectives & KPIs
**Main Objective**: Optimize transportation and logistics performance by identifying root causes of delays, improving on-time delivery, balancing workload across suppliers/routes/materials/customers/vehicles, and reducing overall delivery time in a high-volume regular shipment operation  

**Key KPIs:**  
**Delayed %**: Percentage of shipments that are delayed out of total bookings. Measures overall on-time delivery performance.  
**Avg Delivery Time (days)**: Average time from Booking Date to Actual ETA. Evaluates the speed of order fulfillment across the system.  
**Avg Distance Travelled (KM)**: Average transportation distance per shipment. Helps identify long-haul routes and their impact on cost/time.  
**Top 5 Delayed Elements**: Number or rate of delays in the top 5 routes/materials/suppliers/customers/vehicles. Identifies primary bottlenecks for targeted improvement.  
**Quarterly Delayed Deliveries Trend**: Number of delayed shipments by quarter. Tracks delay patterns over time to detect seasonal peaks or year-over-year improvements.

# Key Results:
     Delays at 61.5% (2,187 cases), with delayed trips averaging 13.26 days and 1,019 km vs. 0.91 days and 503 km for on-time.  
     Top delayed materials: Auto Parts (807 cases), Empty Trays (152).  
     Top delayed routes: Khorajnanoda, Ahmedabad, Gujarat - Singaperumalkoil, Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu (91 cases).  
     Top delayed suppliers: Ekta Transport Company (185 cases), Trans Cargo India (170 cases). 
     Top delayed vehicles: 32 FT Multi-Axle 14MT (694 cases).
     Top delayed customers: Larsen & Toubro (777 cases).
     Quarterly delayed trend: Peak in 2020 Q3 (1,340 cases), low in 2019 Q4 (19).  

# Recommended Actions:  
     Prioritize route optimization for distances >1,000 km and materials like Auto Parts, Empty Trays through dedicated short-haul vehicles and real-time tracking.   
     Redistribute load from overloaded suppliers (Ekta, Trans Cargo) and customers (Larsen, Ford) to reduce concentration risk.  
     Enhance vehicle maintenance for high-delay types like 32 FT Multi-Axle 14MT.  
     Implement seasonal planning for Q3 peaks to cut delays.
